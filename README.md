## This repository contains small projects on deep learning.

### MLP & CNN_MNIST: 

These are two sanity check projects that apply CNN and MLP to MNIST dataset.

### CNN_Rice:

This project utilizes the Rice Image Dataset found [here](https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/). The CNN model can reach a final accuracy of 99%. Printing format is referenced from [here](https://pytorch-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/chapter03_intermediate/3_2_1_cnn_convnet_mnist/).
